# Intuji-MidLevel-QA-Challenge
This is challenge for Automation Interview.

Before running the project make sure that all the requirements are met. 

1. Python Version: Python 3.12.2
2. Make virtual environment using command: py -m venv venv
3. Activate the environment: .\Scripts\activate
4. Install pip: py get-pip.py
5. Intialize all the requirements using requirements.txt file.
6. Add a .env file in root dir and write the credentials there so that credentials are hidden from other.

You are ready to run the tests ;D

Before Execution What to do?
- It is always crutual to keep .env file ignored but for ease I am keeping the file in the ROOT REPO
- Signup is done only one time so make sure you change the credentials from .env file everytime before you run the signup test case.
